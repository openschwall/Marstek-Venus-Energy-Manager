## Key Features

### 1. Core Functionality: Dynamic Power Control
This is the primary operating mode of the integration, designed to maximize self-consumption.
*   **Zero Export/Import (PD Controller)**: A built-in Proportional-Derivative controller continuously monitors your grid meter (e.g., Shelly EM) and adjusts battery charge/discharge rates to keep grid exchange close to 0W.
*   **Oscillation Prevention**: Advanced logic with "Deadband" and "Derivative Gain" prevents the battery from wildly swinging between charge/discharge during sudden load spikes (like a coffee machine toggling on/off).
*   **Hardware Control**:
    *   Set maximum charge and discharge power limits.
    *   Configure minimum and maximum SOC operational limits.
    *   Force charge or discharge modes manually.

### 2. Advanced: Predictive Grid Charging
**Optional** feature that operates independently of normal usage to ensure energy security.
*   **Smart Energy Balance**: The system intelligently decides *if* and *how much* to charge from the grid overnight based on:
    1.  **Usable Energy**: Current battery level above discharge cutoff.
    2.  **Solar Forecast**: Expected production for tomorrow (via Solcast/Forecast.Solar).
    3.  **Consumption Forecast**: 7-day rolling average of your actual home usage.
*   **The Logic**: If `(Usable Battery + Solar Forecast) < Expected Consumption`, it charges from the grid during cheap overnight hours to cover *exactly* the deficit.
*   **Cost Saving**: If there is a surplus, it stays idle, saving you money by not buying unnecessary grid power.

### 3. Additional Management Features
*   **Real-time Monitoring**: View battery SOC, power flow, voltage, current, temperature, and cell-level health.
*   **Multi-Battery Support**: Seamlessly manage up to 4 batteries as a single aggregated system.
*   **No-Discharge Time Slots**: Prevent battery discharge during specific times (e.g., peak grid rates).
*   **Weekly Full Charge**: Option to force a full charge once a week for cell balancing.
*   **Load Exclusion**: "Hide" specific heavy loads (like EV chargers) from the battery to prevent rapid draining.

## Requirements

*   **Hardware:** 
    *   Marstek Venus E v2/v3 Battery.
    *   **Modbus to WiFi Converter:** A device to bridge the battery's RS485 Modbus to your network via TCP. (e.g., **Elfin-EW11**).
    *   **Grid Consumption Sensor:** A Home Assistant sensor tracking your home's total grid consumption (e.g., from a Shelly EM3, Neural, or smart meter integration).
*   **Network:** The battery must be on the same network as Home Assistant or reachable via IP.
*   **Home Assistant:** Recent version (tested on 2024.x).
*   **(Optional) Solar Forecast:** A sensor providing tomorrow's solar forecast (in kWh) is required for the Predictive Grid Charging feature.

## Configuration Walkthrough

This integration is configured entirely via the Home Assistant UI.

### 1. Initial Setup
*   Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
*   Click **+ ADD INTEGRATION**.
*   Search for **Marstek Venus Energy Manager**.

### 2. Main Household Sensor
*   **Consumption Sensor**: Select the sensor that measures your home's total grid consumption (W or kW). This is critical for the integration to calculate load and managing battery behavior relative to the grid.

### 3. Battery Setup
*   **Number of Batteries**: Select how many Marstek Venus units you have (1-4).
*   **Battery Configuration** (Repeated for each battery):
    *   **Name**: Give your battery a unique name (e.g., "Venus Battery 1").
    *   **Host**: The IP address of the battery (or the Modbus-TCP bridge/stick connected to it).
    *   **Port**: The Modbus TCP port (default is `502`).
    *   **Version**: Select your battery model (`v1/v2` or `v3`).
    *   **Max Charge/Discharge Power**: Select the rated power of your setup (e.g., `2500W`).
        > [!CAUTION]
        > **Safety Warning:** Only use the **2500W** mode if you are sure that your domestic installation can withstand such power.
    *   **SOC Limits**:
        *   **Max SOC**: Stop charging at this percentage (default 100%).
        *   **Min SOC**: Stop discharging at this percentage (default 12%).
    *   **Charge Hysteresis**: (Optional) Prevent rapid cycling near the charge limit.

### 4. Time Slots (Optional)
You can define specific time periods where the battery is **forbidden from discharging**. This is useful for saving battery power for evening peaks or overnight usage.
*   **Enable**: Check "Configure time slots".
*   **Add Slot**:
    *   **Start/End Time**: Define the window (e.g., `14:00` to `18:00`).
    *   **Days**: Select applicable days of the week.
    *   **Apply to charge**: (Advanced) If checked, this slot also restricts charging.

### 5. Excluded Devices (Optional)
This feature allows you to "mask" high-power devices so the battery doesn't try to cover their load. For example, if you turn on a 7kW car charger, you might not want your 2.5kW battery to drain itself instantly.
*   **Enable**: Check "Configure excluded devices".
*   **Add Device**:
    *   **Power Sensor**: The entity measuring the power of the heavy load (e.g., `sensor.wallbox_power`).
    *   **Included in Consumption**: Check this if your *Main Household Sensor* (step 2) already sees this load. Uncheck if it's on a separate circuit not monitored by the main sensor.

### 6. Predictive Charging (Optional)
Automatically charge the battery from the grid during a specific window if tomorrow's solar forecast is low.
*   **Enable**: Check "Configure predictive charging".
*   **Settings**:
    *   **Time Window**: When effectively to charge from grid (usually night time/off-peak, e.g., `02:00` - `05:00`).
    *   **Solar Forecast Sensor**: A sensor providing tomorrow's energy production estimate in **kWh** (e.g., from Solcast or Forecast.Solar).
    *   **Max Contracted Power**: The limit of your grid connection (W). The system ensures charging + house load doesn't trip your main breaker.

> [!NOTE]
> **Notification**: The system will send a Home Assistant notification **one hour before** the configured start time. This notification details the calculated required charge and whether grid charging will be activated. This gives you sufficient time to use the **Override Predictive Charging** switch if you disagree with the decision.

### 7. Weekly Full Charge (Optional)
LFP batteries need to hit 100% periodically to balance individual cells.
*   **Enable**: Check "Configure weekly full charge".
*   **Day**: Select the day of the week (e.g., `Sunday`) to force a charge to 100%, overriding any other limits.

### 8. Advanced PD Controller (Expert Mode)
> [!WARNING] 
> **EXPERT SETTINGS ONLY:** Do NOT modify these values unless you fully understand PID control theory and how it interacts with battery inverter response times. Incorrect tuning can cause power oscillations or unstable behavior.

The integration uses a PD (Proportional-Derivative) controller to manage battery power output based on grid consumption.
*   **Kp (Proportional Gain)**: Controls how aggressively the battery responds to grid imbalance. Higher values = faster response but potential for overshoot.
*   **Kd (Derivative Gain)**: Provides damping to prevent oscillations. Higher values = smoother transitions but slower settling time.
*   **Deadband**: The "ignore" zone around zero grid export/import (Watts). The battery won't adjust if grid power is within this range, preventing constant micro-adjustments.
*   **Max Power Change**: The maximum allowable change in battery power output per control cycle (Watts). Prevents sudden large power swings that could stress the inverter.
*   **Direction Hysteresis**: The power threshold (Watts) required to switch between charging and discharging. Prevents rapid flipping between modes when consumption is hovering around zero.
